# Matrix Chain Multiplication

Given an array `arr[]` which represents the dimensions of a sequence of matrices where the ith matrix has the dimensions `(arr[i-1] x arr[i])` for `i >= 1`, find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices together. The efficient way is the one that involves the least number of multiplications.

## Examples

**Input:** `arr[] = [2, 1, 3, 4]`  
**Output:** `20`  
**Explanation:**  
There are 3 matrices of dimensions 2 × 1, 1 × 3, and 3 × 4. Let these 3 input matrices be M1, M2, and M3. There are two ways to multiply: `((M1 x M2) x M3)` and `(M1 x (M2 x M3))`.  
- `((M1 x M2) x M3)` requires `(2 x 1 x 3) + (2 x 3 x 4) = 30`  
- `(M1 x (M2 x M3))` requires `(1 x 3 x 4) + (2 x 1 x 4) = 20`  
The minimum of these two is `20`.

**Input:** `arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3]`  
**Output:** `30`  
**Explanation:**  
There are 4 matrices of dimensions 1 × 2, 2 × 3, 3 × 4, 4 × 3. Let these 4 input matrices be M1, M2, M3, and M4. The minimum number of multiplications are obtained by `((M1 x M2) x M3) x M4`. The minimum number is `(1 x 2 x 3) + (1 x 3 x 4) + (1 x 4 x 3) = 30`.

**Input:** `arr[] = [3, 4]`  
**Output:** `0`  
**Explanation:**  
As there is only one matrix, there is no cost of multiplication.

## Constraints

- `2 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 100`
- `1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 200`
