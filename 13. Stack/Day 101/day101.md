# Next Greater Element

Given an array `arr[]` of integers, the task is to find the next greater element for each element of the array in order of their appearance in the array. The next greater element of an element in the array is the nearest element on the right which is greater than the current element. If there does not exist a next greater element for the current element, then the next greater element for the current element is `-1`. For example, the next greater element of the last element is always `-1`.

## Examples

**Input:** `arr[] = [1, 3, 2, 4]`  
**Output:** `[3, 4, 4, -1]`  
**Explanation:** The next larger element to 1 is 3, 3 is 4, 2 is 4 and for 4, since it doesn't exist, it is -1.

**Input:** `arr[] = [6, 8, 0, 1, 3]`  
**Output:** `[8, -1, 1, 3, -1]`  
**Explanation:** The next larger element to 6 is 8, for 8 there is no larger element hence it is -1, for 0 it is 1, for 1 it is 3 and then for 3 there is no larger element on the right and hence -1.

**Input:** `arr[] = [10, 20, 30, 50]`  
**Output:** `[20, 30, 50, -1]`  
**Explanation:** For a sorted array, the next element is the next greater element except for the last element.

**Input:** `arr[] = [50, 40, 30, 10]`  
**Output:** `[-1, -1, -1, -1]`  
**Explanation:** There is no greater element for any of the elements in the array, so all are -1.

## Constraints:
- `1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 10^6`
- `0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 10^9`
