# Maximum Consecutive 1's After Flipping

Given a binary array `arr[]` (containing only 0s and 1s) and an integer `k`, you are allowed to flip at most `k` 0s to 1s. Find the maximum number of consecutive 1's that can be obtained in the array after performing the operation at most `k` times.

## Examples

### Example 1
**Input:** 
```python
arr[] = [1, 0, 1]
k = 1
```
**Output:** 
```
3
```
**Explanation:** 
Maximum subarray of consecutive 1's is of size 3 which can be obtained after flipping the zero present at the 1st index.

### Example 2
**Input:** 
```python
arr[] = [1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
k = 2
```
**Output:** 
```
5
```
**Explanation:** 
By flipping the zeroes at indices 4 and 6, we get the longest subarray from index 3 to 7 containing all 1â€™s.

### Example 3
**Input:** 
```python
arr[] = [1, 1]
k = 2
```
**Output:** 
```
2
```
**Explanation:** 
Since the array is already having the max consecutive 1's, hence we don't need to perform any operation. Hence the answer is 2.

## Constraints
- `1 <= arr.size() <= 10^5`
- `0 <= k <= arr.size()`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 1`
