# Symmetric Tree

Given a root of a Binary Tree. Your task is to check whether it is Symmetric or not, i.e. whether the binary tree is a mirror image of itself.

## Examples:

**Input:** `root[] = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 3]`  

![Example 1](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240926171713/ex-1_1.webp)  

**Output:** True  
**Explanation:** Tree is mirror image of itself i.e. tree is symmetric.

**Input:** `root[] = [1, 2, 2, N, 3, N, 3]` 

![Example 2](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20240926171713/ex-2_1.webp)  

**Output:** False  
**Explanation:** Tree is not mirror image of itself i.e. tree is not symmetric.

## Constraints:
- `1 <= number of nodes <= 2000`
