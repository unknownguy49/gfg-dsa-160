# Square Root

Given a positive integer `n`, find the square root of `n`. If `n` is not a perfect square, then return the floor value.

Floor value of any number is the greatest integer which is less than or equal to that number.

## Examples

**Input:** `n = 4`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** Since 4 is a perfect square, its square root is 2.

**Input:** `n = 11`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** Since 11 is not a perfect square, the floor of the square root of 11 is 3.

**Input:** `n = 1`  
**Output:** `1`  

## Constraints

- `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 x 10^4`
