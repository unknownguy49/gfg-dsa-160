# GfG 160 - 160 Days of Problem Solving

Welcome to the **GfG 160 - 160 Days of Problem Solving** repository! This repository contains my daily solutions for the GeeksforGeeks event, where I solve a new problem every day for 160 days.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by days, with each day's solution stored in its respective folder:

```
.
├── Day 1
│   └── solution.md
├── Day 2
│   └── solution.md
├── Day 3
│   └── solution.md
...
├── Day 160
│   └── solution.md
```

## Daily Updates

I will be uploading my solutions for each day in their respective folders. Each folder will contain a `day(n).md` file with the problem statement, a `day(n).java` file for the solution.

## Contact

If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to open an issue or contact me directly.

Happy coding!
