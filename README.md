# GfG 160 - 160 Days of Problem Solving

Welcome to the **GfG 160 - 160 Days of Problem Solving** repository! This repository contains my daily solutions for the GeeksforGeeks event, where I solve a new problem every day for 160 days.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by days, with each day's solution stored in its respective folder:

```
.
├── Bonus Problems
│   ├── Arrays
│   │   ├── Problem 1
│   │   ...
│   │   └── Problem 4
│   │   
│   └── Strings
│
├── Day 001
│   ├── day1.md
│   └── day1.java
│
├── Day 002
│   ├── day2.md
│   └── day2.java
│
├── Day 003
│   ├── day3.md
│   └── day3.java
...
├── Day 160
│   ├── day160.md
│   └── day160.java
```

## Topic-Wise Division
- **Arrays**: Day 1 - Day 13
- **Strings**: Day 14 - Unknown
- **Bonus problems**

## Daily Updates

I will be uploading my solutions for each day in their respective folders. Each folder will contain a `day{n}.md` file with the problem statement, a `day{n}.java` file for the solution.
